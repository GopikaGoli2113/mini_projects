This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that explores and analyzes coffee quality data sourced from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI). The analysis focuses on understanding the impact of sensory attributes, processing methods, defect counts, and country of origin on overall coffee quality.

Objective:

To gain insights into factors influencing coffee quality by analyzing various attributes such as aroma, flavor, body, sweetness, acidity, and defect presence.

Key Features:

* Interactive dashboards for exploring coffee quality metrics.

* Comparison of average cup points across countries and processing methods.

* Sensory attribute analysis by country of origin.

* Visualization of defect impact on total cup scores.

Technologies Used

* Power BI Desktop

* Coffee Quality Dataset (CQI)

Dashboard Highlights:

* Average Total Cup Points by country and processing method.

* Sensory Scores (aroma, flavor, body, acidity, sweetness) across origins.

* Defect Analysis and its correlation with quality scores.

* Filters for origin, processing method, variety, and harvest year to customize views.

How to Use:

* Open the provided Power BI report (.pbix file) in Power BI Desktop.

* Interact with the slicers (country, processing method, variety, harvest year) to filter and explore the data.

* Navigate through pages using provided links within the report.

Insights Derived:

* Identified top-performing countries in terms of cup scores.

* Highlighted processing methods associated with higher quality ratings.

* Examined the negative impact of defects on overall coffee scores.

Credits:

* Dataset: Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)

* Developed as part of a data visualization capstone project.
